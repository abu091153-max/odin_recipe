    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Roasted mushrooms are a fantastic "umami bomb" that can serve as a meaty side dish or a topping for steak, pasta, or polenta. The key to perfect roasted mushrooms is high heat and not crowding the pan—this ensures they brown and crisp rather than steam.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Acid</li>
        <li>Aromatics</li>
        <li>Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp paper towel (don't soak them, or they’ll get soggy).</li>
        <li>Toss: In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms with the oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, and herbs. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Arrange: Spread them out on a large rimmed baking sheet. Crucial Tip: Make sure they are in a single layer with space between them. If they touch too much, they will release water and boil instead of roasting.</li>
        <li>Roast: Bake for 20–25 minutes, tossing once halfway through. They are done when they are shrunken, browned, and slightly crisp on the edges.</li>
        <li>Finish: Remove from the oven and immediately toss with fresh parsley and an optional squeeze of lemon to brighten the earthy flavors.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Congrats! You have your lovely roasted mushroom!</p>
